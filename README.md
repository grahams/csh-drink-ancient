# csh-drink-ancient

I was poking around a backup of my old BeOS machine and came across this
old Perforce checkout of ancient Drink code.  This code appears to predate
the current 'ancestry' of Drink, going back to the older hardware before we
replaced everything with onewire switches and TINIs.

I have no idea who the author(s) of this code was.
